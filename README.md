This project is a mini-application for analyzing the GPS traces of an athlete.

In this project, I propose:

    A tool for reading GPX data traces from GPS devices.
    A tool for converting GPX traces into CSV format.
    Analysis and visualization tools for these traces.
    Predictive models such as predicting calories burned based on weight, age, and distance covered.
